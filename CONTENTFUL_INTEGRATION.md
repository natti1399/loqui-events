# Contentful Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Contentful SDK Integration
- âœ… Installed `contentful` package
- âœ… Created Contentful service (`src/services/contentful.ts`)
- âœ… Added environment variables (`.env`)
- âœ… Updated App.tsx to fetch from Contentful

### 2. Environment Variables
The following variables are configured in `.env`:
```
VITE_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=ixirvtpmo7ur
VITE_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=DReC3ZADoydiBbjnp9x7YIHECshmmg4mEiFy2qISnRM
VITE_CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
```

### 3. Content Type Structure
Your Contentful should have an "Event" content type with these fields:
- **title** (Short text) - Event name
- **description** (Long text) - Event description
- **date** (Date & time) - Event date and time
- **location** (Short text) - Event location
- **stripePaymentLink** (Short text) - Stripe payment URL
- **featuredImage** (Media) - Event image (optional)
- **category** (Short text) - Event category
- **published** (Boolean) - Whether event is published

### 4. How It Works
1. The website now fetches events from Contentful on page load
2. Only published events are shown
3. Events are automatically sorted by date
4. The Stripe payment links work directly from Contentful

### 5. Next Steps for Content Management
1. **Create your first event in Contentful:**
   - Go to your Contentful space
   - Create a new "Event" entry
   - Fill in all the fields
   - Set "published" to true
   - Publish the entry

2. **Test the integration:**
   - The website should automatically show your new event
   - No code changes needed!

### 6. Benefits
- âœ… Non-technical content management
- âœ… Real-time updates (no deployments needed)
- âœ… Mobile-friendly admin interface
- âœ… Integrated Stripe payment links
- âœ… Image management
- âœ… Draft/publish workflow

## Development Server
The website is running at: http://localhost:3001/

## Ready for Production!
Once you create events in Contentful, push the changes to GitHub and Netlify will automatically deploy the updated website with Contentful integration.
